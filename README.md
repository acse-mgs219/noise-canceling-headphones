# Noise Canceling Headphones
The focus of the work of this project was Active Noise Cancelling technology in general. In particular, we looked at how this technology can be implemented and developed to effectively cancel variable frequency noise. Basing our research on previous work done by fellow university students, we developed a circuit that, through implementing an adaptive algorithm, was capable of performing variable frequency noise attenuation.

As part of the project pilot, we started by looking at a previously performed noise cancellation project, taking the time to reproduce its circuit on Multisim and test it to verify its function. It was important here to understand exactly how it works, i.e., the overall purpose of the design, the function of each component as well as the circuit’s performance when fed with noise samples.

The second part of this project included the development of an active noise cancellation circuit capable of performing variable frequency noise attenuation. Developed using the LabView platform, the designed circuit was tested on multiple noise samples, each of different varying amplitude, frequency, and length. It worked using the adaptive LMS algorithm.

One of the future goals of the previous project worked on by our colleagues was to build a system that can “give the circuit an adaptive nature where having a noise whose frequency varies is not a problem.” It was our hope in this report to pick up where they left off, implement their design and enhance it into a more effective and applicable system.
